# Revised Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Major Architecture Changes

The WTree project has been **fundamentally redesigned** based on the key insight that it should be a **generic git worktree manager** rather than a tool with hardcoded project assumptions.

### Core Philosophy Change
```
❌ Before: WTree knows about PHP/Laravel, Node.js, SSL certs, .env files
✅ After:  WTree only manages git worktrees; projects define their own setup
```

## 1. What Changed

### 1.1 Removed Hardcoded Project Logic
**No longer in WTree**:
- Composer/npm/bun installation logic
- SSL certificate generation
- .env file copying (hardcoded)
- PHP/Laravel specific assumptions
- Node.js specific assumptions

**Moved to**: Project-defined `.wtreerc` files

### 1.2 New Generic Architecture
**WTree Core Responsibilities**:
- Git worktree lifecycle management
- Path calculation and validation  
- Hook execution framework
- Generic file copy/link operations
- GitHub PR integration (git-focused)

**Project Responsibilities** (via `.wtreerc`):
- Environment setup commands
- Dependency installation
- Configuration file management
- Build processes
- Custom workflows

## 2. New File Structure

### 2.1 WTree Configuration (`~/.config/wtree/config.yaml`)
```yaml
# Tool behavior only - no project assumptions
editor: "cursor"
ui:
  colors: true
  verbose: false
github:
  cli_command: "gh"
  cache_timeout: "5m"
paths:
  worktree_parent: ""  # Auto-detect
```

### 2.2 Project Configuration (`.wtreerc`)
```yaml
# Project-specific behavior
hooks:
  post_create:
    - composer install
    - php artisan migrate
    - npm run build
    
copy_files:
  - .env
  - storage/oauth-*.key

link_files:
  - node_modules
  - vendor
```

## 3. Revised Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Core Components (Simplified)
```
wtree/
├── cmd/                    # CLI commands (unchanged)
├── internal/
│   ├── config/
│   │   ├── wtree.go        # WTree tool configuration
│   │   └── project.go      # .wtreerc parsing
│   ├── git/                # Git operations (unchanged)
│   ├── worktree/
│   │   ├── manager.go      # Core worktree logic (simplified)
│   │   ├── hooks.go        # Hook execution system (NEW)
│   │   └── files.go        # Generic file operations (NEW)
│   └── github/             # GitHub integration (unchanged)
```

### 3.2 Key Interfaces (Revised)
```go
// Hook execution system
type HookExecutor interface {
    ExecuteHooks(event HookEvent, ctx HookContext) error
}

// Generic file operations  
type FileManager interface {
    CopyFiles(patterns []string, from, to string) error
    LinkFiles(patterns []string, from, to string) error
}

// Project configuration
type ProjectConfig struct {
    Hooks           map[HookEvent][]string
    CopyFiles       []string
    LinkFiles       []string
    WorktreePattern string
}
```

## 4. Implementation Benefits

### 4.1 True Genericity
- **Works with any programming language**: Go, Python, Rust, Java, etc.
- **Works with any framework**: Django, Rails, Spring, etc.
- **Works with any build system**: Make, Gradle, CMake, etc.
- **Works with any deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, serverless, etc.

### 4.2 Simplified Codebase
- **No project-specific logic in WTree**
- **Clear separation of concerns**
- **Easier to maintain and test**
- **Fewer dependencies**

### 4.3 Extensible by Design
- **Projects control their own setup**
- **No need to update WTree for new project types**
- **Complex workflows possible via hooks**
- **Backward compatible via migration helpers**

## 5. Migration Strategy

### 5.1 For Your Existing Shell Functions
Your current PHP/Laravel-specific functions can be replicated with:

```yaml
# .wtreerc for your current projects
hooks:
  post_create:
    - cp .env.example .env || cp .env .env  
    - mkdir -p storage/certs
    - openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes \
        -keyout storage/certs/aws-cloud-front-private.pem \
        -out storage/certs/aws-cloud-front-private-cert.pem \
        -sha256 -days 365 \
        -subj "/C=US/ST=California/L=Irvine/O=Acme Inc./OU=Web Technology/CN=stanbridge.edu"
    - composer install
    - bun install

copy_files:
  - .env

# Override global editor if needed
editor: cursor
```

### 5.2 Zero Breaking Changes
- **Phase 1 implements the new architecture**
- **Your workflow remains identical**
- **Just moves project logic to `.wtreerc` files**

## 7. Example Usage After Implementation

### 7.1 Laravel Project
```bash
# In a Laravel project with .wtreerc
wtree feature/auth        # Runs composer install, artisan migrate, etc.
wtree pr 1945            # Creates PR worktree with same setup
wtree merge feature/auth # Runs pre/post merge hooks
```

### 7.2 Go Project  
```bash
# In a Go project with different .wtreerc
wtree feature/api        # Runs go mod tidy, make build, etc.
```

### 7.3 Python Project
```bash
# In a Django project with .wtreerc  
wtree feature/users      # Runs pip install, python manage.py migrate, etc.
```

## 8. Success Metrics (Revised)

### 8.1 Functionality
- [ ] **Complete feature parity** with existing shell functions
- [ ] **Zero hardcoded project assumptions** in WTree core
- [ ] **Works with 3+ different project types** (PHP, Go, Node.js)
- [ ] **Hook system supports complex workflows**

### 8.2 Usability
- [ ] **Identical command interface** to current functions
- [ ] **Sub-second response time** for operations
- [ ] **Clear error messages** with actionable suggestions
- [ ] **Simple migration** from shell functions

### 8.3 Architecture Quality
- [ ] **Clean separation** between tool and project logic
- [ ] **Comprehensive test coverage** for core operations
- [ ] **No project-specific dependencies** in WTree
- [ ] **Extensible hook system** for future enhancements

This revised architecture creates a **truly generic git worktree management tool** that will work with any project type while maintaining all the power and convenience of your current workflow.
